Playstation 2 cheat code encryption and conversion tool.

## What the fork?
This fork fixes a few C99 compilation issues I had on modern Windows.  
Confirmed that build works nicely with [GCC 11.2.0 + MinGW-w64 9.0.0 (UCRT)](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw) on Windows 11.  
  
I have tentative plans to de-Windows-ify and library-ize this ol' codebase for use in other projects, or potentially port it to Rust.  
Still a WIP, and pending original authors' blessing.
